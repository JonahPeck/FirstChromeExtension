# FirstChromeExtension
I would like to built a chrome extension and my initial ideas are for an amazon comparison tool whenever you look up a product that is not in amazon you can view top choices for pricing comparison based on what Amazon is selling. 

A chrome extension for food/shopping that verifies ingredients/bobby approved

Chrome extension for seeing the betting lines for any game while you are streaming it on your device

Chrome extension for prospecting within nutrislice, using openai's api to verify information

other ideas for software
